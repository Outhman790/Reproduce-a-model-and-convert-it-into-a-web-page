Showcase Design Website

This repository contains the code for the Showcase Design website, including the HTML, CSS, and image assets. The website is designed to showcase the company's services and provide information to potential clients.
Files

    img-sites/: This folder contains the images used in the website.
    Figma Link.txt: This text file contains the link to the Figma design file for the website.
    index.html: This is the main HTML file that represents the structure of the website.
    maquette (figma).fig: This is the Figma design file for the website, which was used as a reference to create the HTML and CSS code.
    style.css: This CSS file contains the styles and layout for the website.

How to Use:

To view the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The HTML file contains the structure of the website, while the style.css file defines the visual styles and layout.

Additional Notes

    The HTML code follows the HTML5 standards and uses semantic tags such as <header>, <main>, <footer>, and <nav> to structure the content.
    The social media links were missing in the footer of the original design. I have added them using the Font Awesome library to incorporate the respective icons.
    The navigation menu has a hover effect applied to the links, which provides a visual indication when the user hovers over them.
    The navigation menu is sticky on scroll, meaning it remains fixed at the top-right corner of the page when scrolling down.
